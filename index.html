        <p> Bonnethead sharks are the smallest members of the hammerhead shark family, Sphyrnidae. Recognizable by their distinct shovel-shaped head, bonnethead sharks are found in warm, shallow coastal waters. <br> In the Atlantic Ocean, bonnethead sharks are primarily found off the coast of North Carolina to southern Brazil, including the Gulf of America and Caribbean Sea. </br> <br> Although it’s rare, they have been seen as far north as Rhode Island. In the Pacific Ocean, the species’ range spans from southern California to Ecuador. They are rarely seen north of San Diego. </br> </p>

        <p><br> The pelagic thresher is the smallest of the three thresher shark species, averaging about 3 meters (10 feet) long. Primarily an open-ocean dweller, this species inhabits the warm waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. </br> <br> It is easily recognized by its strikingly long upper caudal fin lobe, which can make up over half its body length. While hunting, thresher sharks likely use their elongated tail to slap the water and stun schooling fish, </br> <br> as well as to corral a school of prey into a tight ball, making it easier to catch and eat. They feed mostly on fish, such as herrings and mackerels, but will also eat pelagic squid. </br> </p> </div>
